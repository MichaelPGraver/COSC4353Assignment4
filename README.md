# COSC4353Assignment3
Assignment 3 for COSC4353

For the sake of this assignment there are hard coded values for the correct username and password. The username is "cosc4353" and the password is "password123". Using these credentials will display a successful login notification and progress you further into the website while using the wrong credentials will display an uncuccesful login and stop you from going further into the website. We could not come up with a good way to move variables in between components and if we did it would've been overwrtitten by DB in the next assignment so that is the reason for the hard coded username and password.

Instructions to run :
1. open terminal
2. cd to the project folder
3. type "npm install"
4. type "npm start" to run project
